referents of noun phrases, ignoring their syntax. However, syntax
depends on discourse function; NPs which introduce new entities are
often more complex. We develop a generative model for NP syntax which
describes this difference. It can be used to model discourse coherence
in the Wall Street Journal; combining it with the local coherence
model of Elsner ('07) yields substantial improvements. Our model is
competitive with previous systems on the discourse-new detection task;
its performance is comparable to Uryupina ('03)."

{T}he turn-taking behavior of participants is treated as a supervised sequence labeling problem and modeled using first- and second-order {C}onditional {R}andom {F}ields.  {W}e specifically explore the hypothesis that discourse markers and personal references provide important features in such models.  {R}esults from a sequence prediction experiment demonstrate that incorporating these two types of features yields significant improvements in performance.  {T}his work is couched in the broader context of developing tools to support legal scholarship, although we see other {NLP} applications as well.

	Abstract = {We describe a new approach to speech recognition, in which all Hidden Markov Model (HMM) states share the same Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) structure with the same number of Gaussians in each state. The model is defined by vectors associated with each state with a dimension of, say, 50, together with a global mapping from this vector space to the space of parameters of the GMM. This model appears to give better results than a conventional model, and the extra structure offers many new opportunities for modeling innovations while maintaining compatibility with most standard techniques.

abstract = {The organization of taking turns to talk is fundamental to conversation, as well as to other speech-exchange systems. A model for the turn-taking organization for conversation is proposed, and is examined for its compatibility with a list of grossly observable facts about conversation. The results of the examination suggest that, at least, a model for turn-taking in conversation will be characterized as locally managed, party-administered, interactionally controlled, and sensitive to recipient design. Several general consequences of the model are explicated, and contrasts are sketched with turn-taking organizations for other speech-exchange systems.},
